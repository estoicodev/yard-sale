# Yard Sale
An E-commerce with HTML, CSS and JavaScript Vanilla.

The project design is from [Platzi's Practical Frontend Developer course](https://platzi.com/cursos/frontend-developer-practico/).
I added visual functionality on the home page when adding products to the shopping cart and to see the product detail of each product.

The project is fully responsive.
